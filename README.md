## Week 01

- in the week01 dir, make a new HTML file
- try to include all interactive HTML elements that you can think of
- pick one such element and change the standard appearance
- change the appearance of the elements on as many states as you can think of:
  - hover, focus, valid/invalid, empty, active, visited, ect.
  - make yourself a "test bed" such that you can visually check for conflicts.
